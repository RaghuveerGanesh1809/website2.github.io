        <pre id="three">
                                                 A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies, 
                                                 such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. The front-end and back-end 
                                                 of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.

                                                 In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, they would leverage 
                                                 front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools like 
                                                 Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.

                                                 The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.
                                                 The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform. 
                                                 Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high demand in the software development sector.
